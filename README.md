### About ME
I am really excited to learn new technology.  I figured out how to make this website self learning in an hour. These files are attached, now i have to make github host the right file and not this readme file. Then I will learn how to make it beautiful.

#### What have I worked on so far?
I am a Flutter mobile developer.  I have produced the Android/ iSO app for StableForm.

 [StableForm]("https://stableform.com")
 
visit the playstore to download the app. Here you can also see screen shots of what the app does.
[GooglePlayStore]("https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.stableform.stableform&pli=1")

I am completing an on-demand Flutter and Dart boot camp.  Over 500 hours worth of course material.
